Praat Scripts for acoustical analysis and semi-automatic annotations

Here are a few scripts I wrote for differents projects. 
Most of them need a wav file and a textgrid with transcriptions or aligned phones segmentations to run.
They have a formular that pop up when you run them so that the use is easier and one can quickly figure out what kind of data need to be fed to the script.
